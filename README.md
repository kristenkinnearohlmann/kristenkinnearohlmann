### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm **Kristen**, a developer located in Bloomington, MN. A long-time SQL guru, I am expanding my knowledge base into application, web and mobile development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python script to sort out my GitHub repos so I can get all of my code moved off my local machine/Dropbox and into GitHub.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, Ruby, C#, Java, PHP...you name it! I am really enjoying understanding how various languages relate and take on various tasks.
