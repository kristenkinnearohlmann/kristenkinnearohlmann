I'm a developer located in Bloomington, MN. A long-time SQL guru, I am expanding my knowledge base into application, web and mobile development. I've passed my final assessment for the Software Engineering online program from Flatiron School - excited to graduate!!  

I enjoy understanding how various languages relate and take on various tasks. It can be tough to dive in and just keep on trying but I keep a positive attitude and make it fun!

I have participated in a number of [Hack the Gap](https://www.hackthegap.com/) hackathons; for 2021, [my team placed third](https://twitter.com/HackTheGap/status/1375859620464492546?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) in a really strong field of projects! Our project, [CAleidoscope](https://ether-cal-htg2021.netlify.app/) is a way to visualize differently your schedule to get a sense of your emotions and connections around your network and tasks. It was great to work on a different kind of projects with fellow developers from my day job, and I got a taste of React too.
