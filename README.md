### Hello!

I'm a developer located in Bloomington, MN. A long-time SQL guru, I am expanding my knowledge base into application, web and mobile development. Iâ€™m currently working on the Software Engineering online program from Flatiron School. Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, Ruby, C#, Java, PHP...you name it! I am really enjoying understanding how various languages relate and take on various tasks.

About that grey square on September 16, 2020: I normally study and practice coding in the evening after work and after working on Duolingo (French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian!). That evening, I had gotten to my coding work while my dad had been messing around outside; he likes to tinker with stuff around the house when my husband is traveling. Dad comes in, says, "I started a fire in the firepit, you should make s'mores." Now, no one is going to argue with that! So I made and ate s'mores and never finished my coding work for the day - the s'mores tasted great!
